# SonarQube Tools - Raycast Extension

This Raycast extension provides a suite of commands to manage a local SonarQube instance (via Podman) and interact with SonarQube projects. The extension now supports **multi-project** workflows, allowing you to configure and analyze multiple projects seamlessly.

It simplifies common SonarQube workflows, allowing you to start/stop your SonarQube environment, run analyses, and open the SonarQube application directly from Raycast.

## Test Coverage

The extension has comprehensive test coverage to ensure stability and reliability:

- **Overall Coverage** (excluding test utilities):
  - **Commands**: 93.54% statements, 91.83% branches, 86.66% functions, 93.92% lines
  - **Components**: 100% coverage across all metrics
  - **Hooks**: 100% statement coverage, 88.23% branch coverage
  - **i18n**: 91.52% statement coverage, 88% branch coverage, 83.33% functions
  - **Utils**: 97.64% statement coverage, 94.38% branch coverage, 98.12% function coverage

All 300+ tests are now passing with zero failures. We've implemented a consistent and reliable mocking strategy across all test files, which has eliminated flakiness and improved overall test reliability.

> Note: The overall project coverage appears lower when including test utilities and mock files, but all production code is well-covered.

## Project Structure

The codebase follows a well-organized domain-based structure for better maintainability and testability:

```
src/
  commands/        # Raycast command entry points
  components/      # Reusable UI components
  hooks/           # Custom React hooks
  i18n/            # Internationalization system
  services/        # Business logic services
  testUtils/       # Test utilities and helpers
    mocks/         # Mock implementations for testing
    factories/     # Test data factories
  types/           # TypeScript type definitions
  utils/           # Utility functions by domain
    terminal.ts    # Terminal command execution utils
    sonarQubeStatus.ts # SonarQube status checking
    projectManagement.ts # Project data management
    common.ts      # Common types and utilities
    index.ts       # Re-exports from all utils
```

## Recent Improvements

### Project Structure Reorganization (May 17, 2025)

Completed a major reorganization of the project structure for improved maintainability and testability:

- Separated commands, components, hooks, utils, and i18n into distinct directories with clear responsibilities
- Moved all tests into `__tests__` directories adjacent to their implementation files
- Standardized import paths across the codebase
- Fixed all test failures and improved test reliability
- Created README files in each major directory to document its purpose
- Added a comprehensive PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md file documenting the project organization

The codebase has been completely reorganized into a domain-based structure for better maintainability and scalability:

- **Commands Directory**: All Raycast command entry points are now organized in a dedicated `commands/` directory with corresponding tests in `commands/__tests__/`
- **Utils Separation**: The large utils.ts file has been split into domain-specific modules:
  - terminal.ts: Terminal command execution utilities
  - sonarQubeStatus.ts: SonarQube server status checking functions
  - projectManagement.ts: Project loading, saving, and management utilities
- **Test Organization**: Standardized test structure with dedicated test utilities and mocks
  - Command tests in `commands/__tests__/` directories
  - Utility tests in their relevant domains
  - Shared test utilities in `testUtils/` for consistent mocking
- **Type Definitions**: Centralized type definitions in a dedicated directory

This reorganization improves:
- **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify related code
- **Scalability**: New features can be added in their respective domains
- **Testability**: Better organization of test code and test utilities

### Component Architecture Refactoring (May 16, 2025)

The `startAnalyzeOpenSonarQube` component has been refactored into smaller, more testable pieces:

- **Custom Hooks**:
  - `useProjectLoader`: Manages loading and state for projects
  - `useSonarQubePath`: Handles resolving the SonarQube path from preferences
  - `useCommandSequencer`: Contains the command sequence execution logic

- **UI Components**:
  - `ProjectEmptyState`: Handles the empty state UI when no projects are available
  - `ProjectListItem`: Renders individual project items
  - `ProjectsList`: Main list component that integrates the above components

This refactoring improves:
- **Testability**: Each component and hook has a single responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify individual parts
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application

## Continuous Integration

We've set up GitHub Actions to handle our CI pipeline. Tests run automatically when we push changes to main or open a PR.

### What Our CI Does

- Uses macOS runners to match our dev environment
- Runs the full test suite with coverage reports
- Saves those reports where the team can access them
- Gives instant feedback in GitHub's UI

### How to Check Test Results

When a build finishes, head to the Actions tab in our repo. Click on the latest run, and you'll find downloadable coverage reports in the artifacts section. This helps us track which parts of the code might need more testing love.

### Getting Your Dev Environment CI-Ready

Cloned the repo? If you're just getting started:

```bash
# Make sure everything's tracked in git
git add .  

# Commit your changes with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Your helpful commit message here"

# Push to GitHub to trigger the CI run
git push
```

### On Our CI Roadmap

- Adding Codecov to get those fancy coverage visualizations
- Setting up auto-releases when version bumps happen
- Implementing more code quality checks

### Test Organization

We've organized our tests by component, making it easy to maintain and extend. You'll find:

- Core utilities tested in `utils.test.ts` 
- UI testing for the analysis screen in `runSonarAnalysis.test.tsx`
- Form validation tests in `ProjectForm.import.test.ts`
- Plenty more test files covering each command's functionality
