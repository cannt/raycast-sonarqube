# Types Directory

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions used throughout the application.

## Types

- Common interfaces and types
- Type declarations for third-party libraries when needed
- Complex type definitions that need to be shared across multiple files

Centralizing types in this directory helps maintain consistency and reduces duplication across the codebase.
